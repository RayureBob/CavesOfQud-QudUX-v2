# QudUX
This is a fork of [QudUX-2](https://github.com/egocarib/CavesOfQud-QudUX-v2?tab=readme-ov-file) by Egocarib, I am slowly going through errors the game encounters when trying to load the original mod. When it is done, I'll either do a merge request on the original repo or push this project on steam workshop

See the readme of the [original repo](https://github.com/egocarib/CavesOfQud-QudUX-v2?tab=readme-ov-file) for informations about the mod

## Current status

<br>Below, an non exhaustive summary

### Screens

### Patches
This is just somewhat of a backlog. You'll see right there what I still have to work on

⚠️ Patch_XRL_UI_Look - **Works with weird quirks, not usable IMO**<br><br>

❌ Patch_XRL_World_GameObject_Move<br>
❌ Patch_XRL_World_Parts_Physics<br>

Those scripts were fully commented, so I just decided to put them on hold until I've reworked everything else

🛑 Patch_XRL_UI_ConversationUI<br>
🛑 Patch_XRL_UI_CreateCharacter<br>
🛑 Patch_XRL_World_Parts_Description<br>
🛑 QudUX_IngredientSelectionScreen<br>
