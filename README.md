# QudUX
This is a fork of [QudUX-2](https://github.com/egocarib/CavesOfQud-QudUX-v2?tab=readme-ov-file) by Egocarib, I am slowly going through errors the game encounters when trying to load the original mod. When it is done, I'll either do a merge request on the original repo or push this project on steam workshop

See the readme of the [original repo](https://github.com/egocarib/CavesOfQud-QudUX-v2?tab=readme-ov-file) for informations about the mod

## Current status
All API errors have been fixed, excepted some key mapping related code that might require bigger refactoring. I decided to cut the whole feature to be able to test everything else.

- Revamped UI text inventory not working
- Merchants additional dialog options not working
- Hero journal note not working
- Probably other things I didn't yet discovered
